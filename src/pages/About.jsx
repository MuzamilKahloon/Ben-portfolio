            I did not enter the legal field with criminal law in mind. I
            initially saw the legal system as a well-oiled machine that ensured
            only the guilty would be punished. However, my experiences soon
            revealed a more painful reality. Our criminal justice system, though
            not without merit, disproportionately targets vulnerable
            populationsâ€”those with limited resources who are often
            overrepresented behind bars and most in need of help. This systemic
            issue is not confined to the United States but is a global concern.
            It was this disparity that led me to seek change.

            My work is driven by the belief that justice should be focused not
            just on punishment but on human rights and second chances. We are
            more than the worst thing we have done, and how we treat the most
            derided individuals in our society is the truest reflection of who
            we are as a people. My goal is to contribute to a justice system
            that acknowledges human dignity and offers opportunities for
            redemption and rehabilitation.

            I am a visiting professor at IE University Law School in Spain,
            where I teach criminal law and human rights. I have also been
            teaching law and human rights at the University of Minnesota Law
            School since 2020. In 2023, I completed my doctorate in Law at the
            Universidad Carlos III de Madrid. My research focused on comparative
            studies of life sentence practices, particularly the
            reimplementation of life sentences in Spain and the U.S., and the
            human rights implications of such sentences.
